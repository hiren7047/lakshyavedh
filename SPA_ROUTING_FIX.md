# SPA Routing Fix for Vercel

## Problem
When refreshing pages like `/dashboard/games/1f75786e-f54f-4108-af0c-c8a9b5b27a77`, Vercel shows "Page not found" because it tries to find a physical file at that path.

## Solution
Added Vercel configuration to handle SPA routing by redirecting all routes to `index.html`.

## Files Added

### 1. `client/vercel.json`
```json
{
  "rewrites": [
    {
      "source": "/(.*)",
      "destination": "/index.html"
    }
  ]
}
```

### 2. `client/public/_redirects`
```
/*    /index.html   200
```

## How It Works
- **Vercel.json**: Tells Vercel to rewrite all routes to `index.html`
- **_redirects**: Fallback for other hosting platforms
- **React Router**: Handles client-side routing after `index.html` loads

## Testing
After Vercel auto-deployment (2-3 minutes):

1. Go to: `https://lakshyavedh.vercel.app/dashboard/games/1f75786e-f54f-4108-af0c-c8a9b5b27a77`
2. Refresh the page (F5 or Ctrl+R)
3. Page should load correctly instead of showing "Page not found"

## Routes That Should Work
- `/dashboard`
- `/dashboard/games`
- `/dashboard/games/[gameId]`
- `/dashboard/create-game`
- `/dashboard/leaderboard`
- Any other React Router routes

## Deployment Status
✅ Code committed and pushed to GitHub
✅ Vercel will auto-deploy in 2-3 minutes
✅ SPA routing will work after deployment
